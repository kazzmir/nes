![first render](./pics/nes1.jpg?raw=true)
The first time the emulator was able to render an image. This is from the Baseball game. It was very exciting to see an image show up, even if the colors are not exactly correct! Mostly the difficulty in getting to this point was understanding pattern tables and nametables.

![with a palette](./pics/nes-palette.jpg?raw=true)
The same Baseball game but rendered with colors from a palette derived from the pattern attributes. I think the colors are still wrong here, as other rom's show a lot of dark blue as well, but its a step in the right direction.
